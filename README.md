# Traffic-Sign-Classifier
This repository is the neural network that I designed and fine tuned to classify traffic signs. 

I designed a multi-layer convolution neural network to classify traffic sign data. The training was accomplished with MNIST traffic sign dataset and the network is fine tuned to achieve very high accury.
